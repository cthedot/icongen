(in parts based on https://github.com/codepo8/simplethumbnails)

Generate PNG Icons/Favicons for websites (PNG Favicon, Chrome, Opera Coast, iOS touch
icons, IE Windows 8 and IE Windows 8.1 icons).

In addition generate icons for Windows 10 Universal Apps and Windows Store Apps for both Windows and Windows Phone. These icons are generated in "scaled" versions (100, 150, 200, etc) depending on version so these will be *a lot*.

Ideally upload or drop an SVG file to generate all selected icon sets.

known issues
------------
This tool works best in Firefox, Chrome or Microsoft Edge. 
In IE SVG uploads seem to cause problems when used on a canvas (plus the original SVG size is lost). PNG or JPG work here too though.
